# Plant-Disease-Detection


# THE STEPS ARE TAKEN TO COMPLETE THIS PROBLEM
1. MOUNTING GOOGLE DRIVE ON COLLAB NOTEBOOK.
2. VISUALIZING THE IMAGES THAT WE WILL BE WORKING ON.
3. FINDING OUT THE MEAN OF THE DIMENSIONS AND RESIZING ALL IMAGES ACCORDINGLY.
4. CONVERTING THE IMAGES INTO A NUMPY ARRAY AND NORMALIZE THEM.
5. CHECKING CLASS IMBALANCE.
6. SPLITTING THE DATA AND PERFORMING ONE-HOT ENCODING.
7. CREATING THE MODEL ARCHITECTURE, COMPILING THE MODEL AND THEN FITTING IT.
8. PLOTTING THE ACCURACY AND LOSS AGAISNST EACH EPOCH.
9. PREPROCESSING THE TEST DATA AND MAKE PREDICTIONS ON IT.
10. VISUALIZING THE ORGINAL AND PREDICTED LABLES FOR THE TEST IMAGES.

# TOOLS ARE USED IN THIS PROJECT
In this project we will create a Convolutional Neural Network which will be able to predict whether a plant is suffering from a disease. We will use different layers and other hyperparameters for building, training and testing this classifictaion model.We will be using tensorflow and keras for this project.

# WHY IN THIS PROJECTS
Human socity need to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an expected population size, that is predicted to be over 9 billion people. Currently, infections diseases reduce the potential yiled by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experience yiled losses as high as 100%. The widespread distribution of smartphone among crop crowers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020 offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communites growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostic through machine learning and big data.

# Conclusion
We started with loading the dataset into google colab using google drive and visualizing the images. Normalizing is an important step when working with any type of dataset. After that we created a CNN Model which is further used for predicting the plant diseases using the image supplied to model. This model is highly beneficial as it can be used by different agricultural firms and farmers to increase their yield and stop wastage of crops due to disease.
